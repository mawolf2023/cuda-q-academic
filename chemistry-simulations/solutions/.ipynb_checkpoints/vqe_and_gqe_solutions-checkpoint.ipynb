    "# Gound State Preparation of Molecules Using VQE and GQE \n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will provide an introduction to the ground state preparation problem on quantum computers and explore how approaches like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) are a good heuristic, but quickly run into problems. The rest of the lesson will introduce the Generative Quantum Eigensolver (GQE) through CUDA-Q Solver's easy to use API.  GQE is a technique that leverages AI to prepare ground states on the quantum computer with many benefits.\n",

The expectation value is defined as the average energy of the state $\\ket{\\Psi}$ and is represented with the following expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E =  \\bra{\\Psi}H\\ket{\\Psi}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "This energy can be computed for any arbitrary state, but is often most important when obtained from a particular state called the **ground state**. The ground state is defined as the state which produces the lowest expectation value. \n",
    "\n",
    "For chemists, the ground state energy of a molecule provides a wealth of knowledge about its reactivity and chemical properties as most molecules are in the ground state rather than excited states. For quantum computing more broadly, non-physics optimization problems can often be mapped to a Hamiltonian. The ground state of such a Hamiltonian, if obtained, can be sampled to produce high-quality solutions to the original optimization problem.  \n",

However, the wallclock time to run these on a QPU may still be quite costly and produce a practical limitation for VQE.  The barren plateau problem makes this problem worse as larger molecule require many more steps to converge the energy, if it will converge at all.  Gradients can help, but are extremely costly to evaluate in their own right.\n",

    "## The Generative Quantum Eigensolver\n",
    "\n",
    "In an attempt to address the issues posed by VQE for finding molecular ground states, researchers from NVIDIA, U. Toronto, and St Jude Children's Research Hospital developed a technique called the generative quantum eigensolver (GQE) which uses a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) model to sample circuits which approximate a molecule's ground state. \n",
    "\n",
    "This section will explain some of the technical details of GQE, but first consider how this compares to VQE at a high level. The diagram below shows the two workflows. \n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"Images/vqe_and_gqe/gqe_vqe.png\" alt=\"plot\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "Notice that both are similar in the sense that a quantum circuit is prepared and sampled to produce an energy which informs how the model parameters are updated.  The key difference is that with GQE, the optimized parameters are the neural network parameters of the GPT model and not within the quantum circuits.  This provides a much better optimization landscape, avoiding the barren plateau issue. There are further benefits related to pretraining, but these will be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's zoom in a bit on how the GPT model works and circuits are sampled.  First, the model needs a vocabulary.  The natural choice is a set of time evolution operators derived from a chemically inspired ansatz like UCCSD.  In the paper, the authors have a large set of operators of the form $e^{iP_jt_k}$ where $P_j$ is an operator from UCCSD and  $t_k$ is some a time step selected from a range of possible time steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Just as ansatz selection for VQE was critical for convergence, a good vocabulary is key for GQE.  GQE just needs to be given an vocabulary that is flexible enough. It is also possible to select a vocabulary tuned to specific qubit modalities such as those with nearest neighbor connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling process is shown in the figure below.  The GPT model takes the parameters, the vocabulary, an a partially constructed circuits (initially an empty circuit) as inputs.  The GPT model then outputs a logit vector related to the probability of sampling index $i$ corresponding to the $i$-th unitary in the vocabulary.  This index is then appended to the string and fed back into the GPT model until a sequence of $N$ (user specified) indices is created, i.e. the full circuit. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " <img src=\"Images/vqe_and_gqe/gqe_sample.png\" alt=\"plot\" width=\"900\">\n",
    "This is the same process as a large language model (LLM) building a sentence.  If the input sentence is \"The apple is colored...\" A logit would be produced that would sample the token \"red\" with high probability.  The GQE model similarly learns which unitaries help construct a circuit close to the ground state. \n",

    "The impact of temperature is slightly harder to connect to the result, but it can be observed in the plots.   Recall that the temperature tunes the probability that the model samples less likely operators when building the circuit.  Notice the spread of the samples. Clearly, they spread increases as the temperature is raised.  This is important for larger systems where the search space is enormous and there may be many local minima that yield poor solutions.  In the case of $H_2$ the system is simple so there is not as much impact from temperature on the result.\n",

    "Notice in the first plot, the learning rate is so small, the model does not really learn, and the cost goes up even! Essentially, the samples do not guide the training or will do so at such a slow rate it is impractical.  On the flip side, notice how a high learning rate sends massive shocks to the parameters resulting in some large spikes in the loss when higher energy circuits are sampled.  This can cause problems and even cause the model to overshoot the correct answer.  This is particularly a problem when the temperature is high, and the learning rate is high. Try running that case below."

    "\n",
    "The ground state problem is fundamental for chemistry and more broadly quantum computing.  In this notebook you learned how a prototypical variational method like VQE can help solve the problem but comes with a number of its own issues.  Much research is dedicated to solving this problem with clever techniques like AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GQE method is an excellent and pioneering example of an improved approach that can converge with fewer quantum circuit executions, can run in parallel, and result in a pretrained model that can be transferred to other contexts.   Current work is exploring how GQE can be trained on chemical system A and then sample circuits for system B with little or no additional training.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, GQE has already been applied to other domains like combinatorial optimization and shows great promise as a flexible and scalable quantum algorithm.  \n",
